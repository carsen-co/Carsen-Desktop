# CARSEN
A python bot for scraping and tracking mobile.de. Get all data for a specific car make and model directly into a spreadsheet, where you can analyze it. Run the checker to see whether the price has changed since the first search.

## Installation
#### First method
1. clone all github files into a folder  
2. Run the application from main.py
*NOTE - There are some resource files which I am not allowed to share due to collaboration with "Mobile.de"

#### Second method
1. Get the installer here,
version Alpha 0.5.4 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/zfcn4vbiewbaky8/Mobile.de%20Bot%20v.Alpha.0.5.4.exe?dl=0
2. Install the app and run "Mobile.de Bot.exe"

## Running the application (gui, after version Alpha 0.6)
Significant improvements to the GUI. Added multiple pages for each task the bot performs which means: searching, tracking, as well as a "Favorites" feature.
